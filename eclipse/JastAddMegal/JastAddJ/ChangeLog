2012-11-01  Jesper Öqvist <jesper.oqvist@cs.lth.se>

    * All type accesses in accessor methods should be qualified
      Trac ticket: http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/85

2012-09-20 (JO)
    * Modified beaver.Symbol: made the value field non-final and added custom
      clone method. This fixes a "memory leak" when cloning AST nodes.

2012-09-13 (JO)
    * The addSourceFile method now returns the CompilationUnit representing
      the added source file name

2012-09-12 (ES/JO)
    * Applied patch from Emma which fixed a circular type lookup problem
      for generic types. The patch added the new inExtendsOrImplements
      attribute.

2012-07-18 (JO)
    * JastAddJ now uses the relative path to identify compilation units.
      The pathName attribute of compilation units may now be different due to
      this change.
      Using the relative path rather than the absolute path makes it simpler
      for static analysis tools to support relocation between different
      machines.

2012-06-29 (JO)
    * Made field and variable initializer type errors more verbose
    * Fixed error in type lookup that could cause duplicate compilation units
      to be added in the AST (one as a from-source CU, the other as library CU)
      See also http://svn.cs.lth.se/trac/jastadd-trac/ticket/74

2012-05-07 (JO)
    Changed the name of the Java7Backend compiler to JastAddJ (JJ7)

    Changed the name of the Java7Backend generated Jar file to JJ7.jar

2012-05-04 (JO)
    An implementation of createQualifiedAccess was added to AbstractWildcardType
    so that wildcard types do not use the default behaviour of creating a
    qualified type access with package and type name which are undefined for
    wildcard types.

    If a corresponding class file and source file have the same last modified
    timestamp, then the class file will be parsed rather than the source file.

    Final non-static fields now also receive the ConstantValue attribute when
    the value is constant.

    Fixed error that caused faulty bytecode generation when compiling an
    enhanced for statement where the loop variable was a boxed primitive type.

    Fixed definite assignment not propagating to second expression in an
    assert statement.

    Set the ACC_VARARGS flag for variable arity constructors.

2012-05-03 (JO)
    The hostType attribute now always returns the "original" TypeDecl, so for
    example a method in a generic class may be the child of a ParClassDecl but
    hostType will now point to the corresponding GenericClassDecl.
    This fixes an error where extraneous accessor methods were generated for
    some types of method access that did not require an accessor method.

2012-04-26 (JO)
    JastAddJ exits with exit code 0 if it only prints version or help
    information. The version string output by -version was also made shorter.

2012-03-24 (JO)
    Updated to latest JastAdd2 and RagDoll.

2012-03-06 (JO)
    Removed the TypeDecl.subclassWithinBody(TypeDecl) method since the
    purpose of that method was to find an enclosing class inheriting from a
    given superclass C while determining member accessibility.
    Only looking at the directly enclosing subclass of C is not sufficient to
    determine the accessibility of the field or method - all enclsing classes
    must be checked until one that can access the member is found.
    This is the puprpose of the new methods
    TypeDecl.mayAccess(Expr, FieldDeclaration)
    TypeDecl.mayAccess(MethodAccess, MethodDecl)

2012-02-18 (JO)
    Moved the Java7Backend compiler main class to
    org.jastadd.jastaddj.JavaCompiler. A main class with the same name remains
    in the default package, for backwards compatibility.

2011-12-08 (JO)
    Upgraded Beaver to version 0.9.9
    The new version of Beaver uses a new naming convention for the Beaver jar
    files, an effect of this is that the jar file used for Ant tasks is now
    called beaver-ant.jar. Extensions using Beaver in their Ant scripts by
    referencing Java1.4Frontend/tools/beaver.jar should be updated to reference
    Java1.4Frontend/tools/beaver-ant.jar instead.

2011-11-23 (JO)
    Added automatic version number update to build scripts for JJ7.

2011-09-24 (JO)
    Updated the JastAdd2 tool to version R20110924.

2011-09-15 (JO)
    Added isDefaultConstructor flag to ConstructorDecl. Pretty printing
    now ignores auto-generated default constructors. Extensions that rely on
    pretty printing to generate default constructors should refine the
    setDefaultConstructor method to make it do nothing.

2011-06-03 (JO)
    Refactored the Java AST. CatchClause is now an abstract base class
    for BasicCatch, which fills the same role that CatchClause previously had.
    Extensions that use the old CatchClause node type will have to in some
    cases move attribute refines etc. to BasicCatch.

2011-05-12 (JO)
    Modified build files to use more heap memory when running JastAdd2
    using an exec task.

2011-04-01 (JO)
    Errors and warnings are printed on the error stream instead of the
    standard output stream.

2011-08-09 (JO)
    Added build file to root JastAddJ directory with clean target that
    cleans all JastAddJ modules.

2011-08-09 (JO)
    Refactored VariableDeclaration.jrag - moved interface Variable to
    Variable.jadd
